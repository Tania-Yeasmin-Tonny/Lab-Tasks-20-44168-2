Most of the reminders in mobile phones are purely time specific i.e. this will provide alarm only on that particular time. Some tasks are only meaningful to be performed at a specific location. So, this location-based task reminder system is developed. It reminds the user about the location when he/she enters within alert range of the predefined location. All the user need to have is the android mobile phone. The main objective of the research is to develop a GPS (Global Positioning System) based application to handle the following requirements: to provide the alarm to the user when he/she reaches near the preselected destination, to retrieve the usersâ€™ current location geographical coordinates, to allow the users to create the reminder for their target location and save that reminder to the list, to allow the users to delete and edit their reminders in list. Based on the saved location, the alarm will ring automatically and the reminding task detail will display when the user reaches within the target location. The distance between the user current position and the destination can get by using Haversine Formula. This location-based reminder system will act as an assistance for frequent travelers to visit new places with the help of LBS (Location Based Services).
